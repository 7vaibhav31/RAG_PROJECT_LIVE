# ⚡ RAG — AI Document Assistant

**Live Deployment:** [https://emergency-triage-project.vercel.app/#](https://emergency-triage-project.vercel.app/#)

An advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built to act as an intelligent document assistant. Upload clinical notes, reports, or text files, and ask an AI questions grounded *strictly* in your uploaded document.

## 🌟 Features

- **Document Analysis:** Upload `.txt` text documents.
- **Zero Hallucination RAG:** The AI acts as a reading-comprehension engine over your specific document using local TF-IDF vectorization and Cosine Similarity.
- **Interactive Multi-Page Chat:** A beautiful Single-Page Application (SPA) with a warm modern gradient UI, markdown rendering, and animated transitions.
- **Live Telemetry:** Real-time metrics dashboard tracking latency (ms), token speed (tokens/sec), and algorithmic confidence.
- **Free Vercel Deployment:** Embeddings are generated using blazing-fast, lightweight `scikit-learn` algorithms natively in Python to bypass Vercel's strict 250MB serverless constraints.
